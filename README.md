# mediawiki
This will leverage Docker to create a Mediawiki from scratch. Although there is a Mediawiki Docker container, this will use a larger base image that is constantly patched to minimize the inherit vulnerabilities. This will also allow a security team to see everything that is installed and updated without having to use specific tools for scanning.
